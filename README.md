# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices.

Using JavaScript in conjunction with CSS and HTML, I designed a website that allows users to choose to receive a randomly generated affirmation or mantra. In addition, users can navigate to a View All Messages page where they can view and customize the list of randomly generated messages.

### Learning Goals:
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

### Technology Used
- Atom
- HTML
- CSS
- Chrome Dev Tools
- JavaScript
- Github

### Wins:
- Gained a deeper understanding of how to create HTML and CSS to build a webpage that matches the given comp and how the JavaScript works in conjunction with the HTML and CSS to add functionality that allows the user to receive random affirmations or mantras
- Choosing the "All Messages Interface" feature for my "Choose your own adventure" which pushed me out of my comfort zone with regards to my current skill set
- Creating a page to display all messages by type and adding a fully functional delete button to each message and having the page update the messages immediately

### Challenges:
- Due to time constraints, I was not able to add edit message functionality for edit buttons or add the input form for adding a custom messages. I would like to add these features so that users can fully customize their messages.
- I did not have the opportunity to refactor my HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. In the future, I will consider this while pre-planning and calendaring my time.

### Future Features:
- Add functionality to Edit buttons
- Add a form for users to add their own messages on the View All Messages page
- Create local storage
- Allow users to add messages to a favorites list
