# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices.

Using JavaScript in conjunction with CSS and HTML, I designed a website that allows users to choose to receive a randomly generated affirmation or mantra. In addition, users can navigate to a View All Messages page where they can view and customize the list of randomly generated messages.
